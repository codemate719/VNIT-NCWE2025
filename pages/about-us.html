                Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur,
                named after the eminent engineer, planner, and statesman of the
                country Sir M. Visvesvaraya, is one of the thirty National
                Institutes of Technology in the country. It has nine
                undergraduate, eighteen post graduate programs with a total
                student strength of 5000, which includes about 500 PhD scholars.
                A lush-green VNIT campus is sprawled over 214 acres, located
                centrally in the city of Nagpur, with residential facility for
                about 3500 students. Historically, this institute started as a
                Government Engineering College in 1956, got converted into
                Regional Engineering College in 1960 and eventually got the
                status of National Institute in 2002. Today, VNIT is Institute
                of National importance and has ascended itself from a
                teaching-oriented campus to a blend of research and teaching.
                Institute has many R&D projects funded through Government and
                private agencies.

                Nagpur is the third largest city and the winter capital of
                Maharashtra State. Nagpur lies precisely at the centre of the
                country with the Zero Mile Marker indicating the geographical
                centre of India. In the latest rankings of 100 developing smart
                cities given by the Union Ministry of Urban Development, Nagpur
                stood first in Maharashtra state and second in India. Nagpur
                Metro has entered Guinness Book of World Records for being the
                longest double-decker viaduct metro measuring 3.14 km on Wardha
                Road. Known as the “Orange City”, Nagpur has officially become
                the greenest, safest and most technologically developed city in
                the Maharashtra state. Nagpur is also known as the, “Tiger
                Capital of India” as it connects many Tiger Reserves in India to
                the world. It is well connected to all the major cities of the
                country by air and has also international connectivity. Needless
                to say, Nagpur is a major railway junction of North-South and
                East-West railway lines.
